consider a data stored in object. we want to dispaly it to a client.so we need to present it in UI,in MVC, data is model and view is consider and controller decides how to render the data in UI.

spring mvc is popular due to its feature of IoC/DI.

java object holding data is called model
mvc contains few parts like:

Front controller(FC): it recieves a request from client.
Handler Mapper(HM): FC approaches HM to get the actual resource based on the URL recieved. after geting info about
		    actual resource,FC sends the request to that data generater.

spring uses servlets at its core		    

the FC is dispatcher servlet-it reads a file called spring-dispatcher-servlet.xml
