this is 11th example .in prevoius example we saw how context attributes persists betwween one request to other,in this example,we
see how context attributes persists from one servlet to ther ,but request attributes only persists for each requests.

we can see the count value increasing when we refresh the page or load other servlet,but count1,being request attributes,doesnot
increase.


in session examples,we will see session attributes.
