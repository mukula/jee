in this ninth example,we see the request dispatcher (R.D).
first see the action of forward,then just uncomment rd.include(req,res),and see what it does.

The RequestDispatcher interface provides the facility of dispatching the request to another resource it may be html, servlet or jsp. This interface can also be used to include the content of another resource also. 
It is one of the way of servlet collaboration.

if we use sendredirect to call other servlet,then it will not have access to previous response object as it is destroyed after sendredirect,
but by request dispatcher,same response is either forwarded or included,so that called servlet has access to previous request object.

two methods to R.D:

 1)   public void forward(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response)throws ServletException,java.io.IOException:Forwards a request from a servlet to another resource (servlet, JSP file, or HTML file) on the server.
 2)   public void include(ServletRequest request,ServletResponse response)throws ServletException,java.io.IOException:Includes the content of a resource (servlet, JSP page, or HTML file) in the response.
 
 >when we use forward method,the servlets which calls it,simply forward the response and request to other servlet.the servlet which has this method cannot display anything.
 > include method,the response of called servlet is embedded in response of calling servlet and final response is generated by calling sevrlet.
 thus the servlet which invoked include() can display info along with next servlet.
 
 in case of R.D,url of browser is not changed as in case of sendRedirect.
 
 in case of R.D,no new request is generated.the same request is euther forwarded (in forward()) or embedded (in include()).
 
 using R.D,we can share the data via servlet request
 
 using R,D,we can not go beyond servlet context as in case of sendRedirect.
 
 in this example,we can see the attributes also.
 
 we use include when we want to include other pages in dynamically generated webpage. for eg,we can include the templates of footer and header in generated web page.
 we use sendRedirect when we want to display a different page like login or idex page.
 using sendRedirect,we cant pass the request and response objects to redirected page,to do so,we use forward method.
