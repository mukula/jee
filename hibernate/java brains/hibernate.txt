the problem with relation database is its use in java applications.since java is a oop language,we have the data stored inside objects,and when we have to save the objects,we have to 
extract the from the objects and save it in DB and we have to do it always.one solution is to make a class that extracts all the data members from given objects and save it in DB.this class 
will do the job of ORM,but ORM is lot more bigger than this job. so we have a complete framework dedicated for this called Hibernate.Hibernate is a great orm tool.

to use hibernate ,we need to use java bean classes as hibernate uses getters and setter to set and get data.
session factory- one object per application. we can create multiple sessions from session factory.then we can use session to save model objects . we create sessionfactory only once per
application


new Configuration().configure() : it reads the configuration  file and reads the DB configuration.

static members are not persisted by hibernate as static members are meant to be shared by all the classes,so it does not make sense to persist it.
transient members are also not persisted.else we can give the annotation of @Transient

for date,we can use @Temporal annotation

hibernate uses varchar by default for all strings which has limit of 255. we can change it by annotation @Lob(large object)

we can make hibernate to generate primary keys by @Id @GeneratedValue

in hibernate  we use two kinds of objects: entity and value objects.
entity obj: an object that is independent and it contains data that provide meaning about itself.
value obj: an object that does not make sense to itself,it make sense to other object. like a address object make sense for employee object.
generally , objects inside a entity are value objects.but a entity can contain a entity object. 

if we have a object as a data member inside entity class,we must declare the annotation of @Embeddable in class of that member object and @Embedded above the object declaration in entity class.

we can change the name of a field of value object used in DB through entity class by @AttributeOverride.

we can make a value object as primary key i.e combination of data members of value object act as primary  key .it can be done by @EmbeddedId.

we can save collections by @ElementCollection. hibernate creates a separate table for collection.

for one to one mapping use @OneToOne 

in many to many, eg many users are mapped to many vehicles,then we can provide mappedBy attribute in @ManyToMany in any one of the user or vehicle,if it is in user,then we can provide @JoinTable
in vehicle,not in user.

to retrieve data , use UserDao us1=(UserDao)session1.get(UserDao.class,1);//second argument is primary key.
for retrieving data through above statement,we should not set hbm2ddl as create,bcoz the table is dropped and ceated again with no data.

common maistake:-

Vehicle vehicle=new Vehicle();
vehicle.setName("abc");
user.assign(vehicle);
vehicle.setName("xyz");
user.assign(vehicle);


this will not work as expected .only one vehicle is added i.e second one. to avoid it, use:
Vehicle vehicle=new Vehicle();
vehicle.setName("abc");
user.assign(vehicle);
  vehicle=new Vehicle();
vehicle.setName("xyz");
user.assign(vehicle);
