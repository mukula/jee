spring data support in hibernate.

the jdbc code we write to access data base is tedious task.this problem is solved by spring data support.

generally,in java,we wish to store objects in data base. 
in practise ,we make a daoImpl classes to retrive required objects from database. if we use jdbc,we make a class JdbcDaoImpl to retrive required object.after getting that object from database,
JdbcDaoImpl class returns that object. 
the advantage of such practise is that a abstraction of data access is maintained,i.e the way in which we are accessing the database is hidden in DaoImpl classes.we can configure that class 
to work with different types of data access like jdbc , hibernate etc.
