hibernate provide first level of cache i.e by session. when we update a persistent object several time,only one update (last one) is executed,it is due to first level of cache.same is the case 
with other DB operations like select.

---second level of cache:

all individuals caches have separate first level cache,but second level cache is common to whole application and we can cache over different sessions.
