When Struts 2 receives a request, it immediately creates an ActionContext, a ValueStack,and an action object.
then the action object is quickly placed on the ValueStack so that its properties will be accessible, via OGNL.

First, these will receive the automatic data transfer from the incoming request parameters.this occurs because the params interceptor sets
those parameters on properties exposed on the ValueStack, upon which the action object sits.

one tricky bit about the ValueStack: The ValueStack pretends to be a single object when OGNL expressions are resolved against it. This virtual object
contains all the properties of all the objects that’ve been placed on the stack. If multiple occurrences of the same property exist, those lowest down in the stack are hidden
by the uppermost occurrence of a similarly named property.
