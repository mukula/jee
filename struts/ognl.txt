Object graph navigation language: It helps move data from the request parameters onto our action’s JavaBeans properties.

ValueStack ?

to access data from ValueStack , we use ongl expression language.


to access multiple request parameters,we need to initialize arrays,but not lists.

when we use List,its default type is String.to change this type,use xxx.properties file and write Element-weights=java.lang.Double  in it t make type of double. xxx is the name of action class.
when we define the type in this way,we can not preinitialize the List,else we get the error.

we need not initialize the collections like list,map etc.

we can access map by key as user['sai'] , but not by index as user[0].
