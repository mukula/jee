struts 2 architecture:

Servlet filters - Servlet filter comprises of 3 major components, those are ActionContextCleanUp, SiteMesh and FilterDispatcher
1) ActionContextCleanUp- optional -used for integration of struts with other java technologies.
2) SiteMesh- optional - used for look and feel.
3) FilterDispatcher-It is a required filter and used as a link between filters and ActionMapper. FilterDispatcher handles Action execution, cleanup of context.

Struts Core : This is the actual Model part of Struts 2. It contains the main business logic. 
1)  FilterDispatcher: it invokes ActionMapper to check whether incoming request is mapped to any action or interceptor or nothing.
2)  ActionMapper : it Maps the incoming request URI to an action name and namespace.
3)  ActionProxy : it uses ConfigurationFile manager and creates an instance of ActionInvocation which will instantiate Action class.it gets the information from the struts.xml file.
The ConfigurationProvider interface describes the framework's configuration. By default, the framework loads its configurations via an XML document by using the StrutsXmlConfigurationProvider
4)  ActionInvocation: it  will take help of struts.xml file to determine which method of the Action class should be called and instantiates it.
      ActionProxy can also call Interceptors with the help of ActionInvocation.
5) Action: we place the code to be executed in action classes.	 
6)  Interceptors: discussed in Interceptors.txt


overview 

    1]User sends a request for the action
    2]Container maps the request in the web.xml file and gets the class name of controller.
    3]Container invokes the controller (StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter or FilterDispatcher). Since struts2.1, it is StrutsPrepareAndExecuteFilter. Before 2.1 it was FilterDispatcher.
    4]Controller gets the information for the action from the ActionMapper
    5]Controller invokes the ActionProxy
    6]ActionProxy gets the information of action and interceptor stack from the configuration manager which gets the information from the struts.xml file.
    7]ActionProxy forwards the request to the ActionInvocation
    8]ActionInvocation invokes each interceptors and action
    9]A result is generated
    10]The result is sent back to the ActionInvocation
    11]A HttpServletResponse is generated
    12]Response is sent to the user
