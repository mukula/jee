struts 2 architecture:

Servlet filters - Servlet filter comprises of 3 major components, those are ActionContextCleanUp, SiteMesh and FilterDispatcher
1) ActionContextCleanUp- optional -used for integration of struts with other java technologies.
2) SiteMesh- optional - used for look and feel.
3) FilterDispatcher-It is a required filter and used as a link between filters and ActionMapper. FilterDispatcher handles Action execution, cleanup of context.

Struts Core : This is the actual Model part of Struts 2. It contains the main business logic. 
1)  FilterDispatcher: it invokes ActionMapper to check whether incoming request is mapped to any action or interceptor or nothing.
2)  ActionMapper : it Maps the incoming request URI to an action name and namespace.
3)  ActionProxy : it uses ConfigurationFile manager and creates an instance of ActionInvocation which will instantiate Action class.
The ConfigurationProvider interface describes the framework's configuration. By default, the framework loads its configurations via an XML document by using the StrutsXmlConfigurationProvider
4)  ActionInvocation: it  will take help of struts.xml file to determine which method of the Action class should be called and instantiates it.
      ActionProxy can also call Interceptors with the help of ActionInvocation.
5) Action: we place the code to be executed in action classes.	 
6)  Interceptors: discussed in Interceptors.txt
