Attributes passed to Struts 2 tags are divided into two categories. Attributes that’ll be used by the tag as String values are referred to as string attributes.
Attributes that point to some property on the ValueStack, or in the ActionContext are referred to as nonstring attributes. All nonstring attributes will be interpreted 
as OGNL expressions and used to locate the property that’ll contain the value to be used in the tag processing.
